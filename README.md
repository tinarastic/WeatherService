# WeatherService
A weather web service based on SailsJS

# About
The purpose of this application is to provide a JSON based Web API to serve weather information, both forecast and observation data. The application structure is based on the Australian Beaureau of Meterology weather data and interfaces a mongo database.  

At this point it may be of limited use to others as it is built for a specific purpose, but we are making this a public repository in the spirit of the tools we are using to create the solution.
